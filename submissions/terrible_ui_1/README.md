## Terrible UI Hackathon #1 (April 1 6:00PM EST)

```
Challenge: Build the worst Date/Time Selector
```

Come join us April 1 to build the worst UI features you can imagine! Inspired by the [Worst Volume Control](https://uxdesign.cc/the-worst-volume-control-ui-in-the-world-60713dc86950) competition a few years ago on reddit. Each month we'll select a new UI feature, and compete to make it as terrible as possible.
